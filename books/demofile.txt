A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment on your computer, where you can run and test your Python projects.

It allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.

Think of a virtual environment as a separate container for each Python project. Each container:

My name if Fathyy
Timberland is my favourite shoe
I like eating delicious meal
Money is always essencialMy name if Fathyy
Timberland is my favourite shoe
